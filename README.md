## Reimplementation of Git in Python

This is just a fun project that I wish to complete. The goal of this project is to hopefully understand more about how Git works. 
I will be using Python because that is the language that I am most comfortable with. This project also works as a way for me to 
learn more about working with vim. 

### TODO:
(These are all rudimentary implementations and need a proper implementation in the final version. The hope is that these functions will facilitate faster development of the final version)
- [x] Create the `.pyregit` folder which emulates the `.git` folder for all the functionalities.
- [x] `pyregit init`
- [ ] `pyregit add`
- [ ] `pyregit commit` 
- [x] Compression of file objects
- [x] `git cat-file` equivalent
- [x] SHA-1 has of files(objects)
